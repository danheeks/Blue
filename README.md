# Blue
test of distributing a wxPython app

Simply draws a blue window

I made a launchpad repository, which mirrors this github repository and a launchpad recipe, which builds the Ubuntu package.

https://code.launchpad.net/~danheeks/+recipe/blue-daily

It works for Ubuntu 22.04.

To install "blue" on your Ubuntu 22.04 PC, type

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danheeks/ppa
sudo apt-get install blue
```

You will then have an icon on your apps window to start blue
